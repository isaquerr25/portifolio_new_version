Project 1: Integration between Legal One and Neotriade
<br/>

For the law firm Paulo Miro Advogados, I developed an innovative 
software solution integrating two major legal platforms: Legal 
One and Neotriade. This solution automates the exchange of 
information between the systems, allowing data to be synchronized 
efficiently and in real time. The software streamlined the team's 
workflow, ensuring that processes, documents, and essential information 
were always up to date on both platforms, eliminating manual work and 
reducing operational errors. This integration significantly accelerated 
process management and improved decision-making in the firm's daily operations.
<br/>
<br/>
Project 2: Trademark Monitoring Software at INPI
<br/>

I developed a specialized software for monitoring trademark status at INPI 
(National Institute of Industrial Property), meeting the needs of the law 
firm Paulo Miro Advogados. The tool continuously monitors trademark registrations, 
automatically alerting the legal team via email about changes and critical deadlines.

ChronoView is designed to transform how teams collaborate, linking individual tasks like pieces of a puzzle to create a cohesive and efficient workflow.

      With it, you can track the progress of each task, adjust priorities, and ensure that everyone is aligned, from project inception to completion. The platform allows you to link related tasks, visualize progress in real time, and intelligently integrate each team member's demands, making it easier to succeed with complex projects in a structured way.

      ChronoView also integrates seamlessly with platforms like Legal One and INPI, streamlining legal processes and intellectual property management directly into your project workflow. This integration ensures that all critical information is centralized, improving efficiency and collaboration.

      Additionally, ChronoView offers deadline tracking tools, smart notifications, and intuitive visualizations to keep everything organized. It’s my commitment to ensuring that teams not only reach their goals but do so with fluidity and efficiency, consistently driving projects to success.
